worktree.guessRemote::
	If no branch is specified and neither `-b` nor `-B` nor
	`--detach` is used, then `git worktree add` defaults to
	creating a new branch from HEAD.  If `worktree.guessRemote` is
	set to true, `worktree add` tries to find a remote-tracking
	branch whose name uniquely matches the new branch name.  If
	such a branch exists, it is checked out and set as "upstream"
	for the new branch.  If no such match can be found, it falls
	back to creating a new branch from the current HEAD.
worktree.useRelativePaths::
	If set to `true`, the worktree paths will be stored relative to the
	repositoryâ€™s top-level directory, rather than using absolute paths.
	This is particularly useful for setups where the repository may be moved
	between different locations or environments.
